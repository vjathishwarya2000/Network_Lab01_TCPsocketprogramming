Task 01: Java TCP Day-Time-Server 
01. What is the purpose of day time server? 
02. What is the default port for the day time server? 
03. Why the service port is normally declared as ‘final’ and ‘static’?
04. Write and test Day Time Server using Java. 
05. Your program needs to run continuously without stopping after serving a single client. 

Task 02: Java TCP Echo-Server 
01. Echo server should read an input line from the user, and then echo the same content back 
to the user. 
02. What is the default port for the Echo Server? 
03. Write and test Echo Server using Java. 
04. Your program needs to run continuously without stopping after serving a single client. 

Task 03: Java Student Marks Server 
01. Modify the above coded “Echo Server” to accept the “Student Index Number” as the input 
and return Total Marks for the Year for the student. 
02. You may use a map data structure in Java for storing Student Index Number VS Total Marks 
for the year in key-value pairs (Index Number as the Key and marks as the Value). 
03. Your program needs to run continuously without stopping after serving a single client. 
04. NOTE: Your program should not crash when query an invalid student index. 
05. Assuming that index numbers are continuous, explain how you can use an array instead of 
the Map data structure for the purpose? You may write the code and explain. 

Task 04: Java TCP Client 
01. Write a TCP client program using Java which will display the output received from the 
above server program. 
02. Your program needs to accept the server IP and Port (connect information) via command 
line arguments. 
03. With the next person sitting with you in the lab, try to connect to your server program by 
using the client program of the neighbor. And observer the local ip, local port, remote ip, 
remote port printed by the server. What is your observation?
